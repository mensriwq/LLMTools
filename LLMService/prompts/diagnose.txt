The previous code failed.
Code: `{prev_tactic}`
Error: {error_msg}

Current Goal:
{goal_state}

TASK:
1. Briefly analyze WHY it failed (e.g., wrong theorem name, argument mismatch, type error).
2. Determine what keywords to search for to fix this.
   - If the error is about a missing identifier or theorem, verify the name.
   - If the error is about arguments, search the theorem to check its signature (arguments name/type, implicit/explicit arguments, sometimes use @).
   - If it's a syntax error or logical error you can fix without search, use "NONE".
   - If tactics like `omega`, `linarith`, or `aesop` timeout, consider suggesting `clear` to remove unused hypotheses, or use "NONE" for search.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
ANALYSIS: <Short explanation of the error>
SEARCH: <keywords separated by space OR "NONE">
