[Full Theorem]:
{thm_decl}

[Current Goal]:
{goal_state}

[User Hint]:
{hint}

TASK:
Propose a single intermediate lemma (type) that would make progress towards the goal.

GUIDELINES:
1. If the User Hint specifies a lemma (e.g., "use induction on n" or "assert n > 0"), formulate that exact statement.
2. If no hint, analyze the logical gap. What missing fact would make the goal trivial?
3. Define the type clearly using `have` or `suffices`.
4. Leave the proof of this new fact as `sorry`.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
```lean
have h_aux : a + b > 0 := by sorry
```
