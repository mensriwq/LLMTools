[User Hint]:
{hint}

TASK:
Propose a single intermediate lemma (type) that decomposes the problem.

GUIDELINES:
1. **Logic Gap**: What missing fact makes the goal trivial?
2. **Non-Triviality**: Do NOT simply assert the goal itself.
3. **Contrapositives**: You MAY introduce a contrapositive or equivalent form if it makes the proof easier (e.g., transforming a Not-Exists into Forall).
4. **Structure**: Define the type clearly using `have` or `suffices`.
5. **Yield**: If you cannot find a helpful decomposition, output `GIVEUP`.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
```lean
have h_aux : a + b > 0 := by sorry
```
