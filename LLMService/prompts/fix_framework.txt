We are fixing a failed PROOF SKELETON.

1. Full Theorem Statement:
   {thm_decl}

2. CONTEXT
   Failed Skeleton:
   ```lean
   {prev_tactic}
   ```
   Error Message: {error_msg}

3. YOUR DIAGNOSIS
   {diagnosis}

4. SEARCH RESULTS
   {search_results}

5. CURRENT GOAL
   {goal_state}

INSTRUCTIONS:
1. Analyze why the structure failed.
2. Rewrite the proof skeleton inside a ```lean``` block.
3. Ensure syntax is valid and structure is logical.
