TASK:
Analyze the proof structure based on the following definitions:

1. **CHAIN (Linear)**:
   - Use this if the proof is a sequence of causal steps (A leads to B, B leads to Goal).
   - Even if steps are hard, if they are sequential, it is CHAIN.
   - The plan should be a list of **Intermediate Lemmas/Facts** that need to be proven (e.g., "Prove x > 0", "Show f is continuous").

2. **COMPOUND (Branching)**:
   - Use this ONLY if the proof requires splitting into branches immediately (e.g., Induction, Cases, dividing into "left" and "right").
   - The plan is just a brief outline.

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Output a JSON object in a json code block.

Example 1 (Chain):

{{
  "type": "CHAIN",
  "plan": [
    "Prove that x is positive",
    "Show that y is bounded by x"
  ]
}}
```

Example 2 (Compound):
