[User Hint]:

TASK:
Provide a comprehensive PROOF SKELETON for the current goal.
Your output should be a structured Lean 4 proof block that divides the problem into sub-problems.

GUIDELINES:
1. Use high-level tactics like `induction`, `cases`, `calc`, `obtain`, `have`, or `suffices`.
2. Do NOT solve the hard parts. Use `sorry` for the actual proofs of sub-goals.
3. Add brief comments explaining the structure.
4. Ensure the variable names match the context.
5. The code must be syntactically valid Lean 4.

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
```lean
induction n with
| zero =>
  -- Base case logic
  sorry
| succ n ih =>
  -- Step case logic
  have h_aux : n > 0 := by sorry
  rw [Nat.add_comm]
  apply ih
  sorry
```

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY the code block inside ```lean ... ```.
