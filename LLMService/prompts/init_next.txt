TASK: Suggest an efficient next tactic step.

GUIDELINES:
1.  **Automation First**: If `aesop`, `simp_all`, `linarith` etc. can solve it, output that.
2.  **Structure**: You are allowed to use multi-line blocks (e.g., `induction`, `cases`, `calc`) if it represents ONE logical peak.
3.  **The "One Peak" Rule**: Do not write the *entire* proof. Focus on clearing the immediate hurdle.

Your final output MUST be a valid Lean code block.
